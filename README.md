# Language Classification

This repository contains a number of ways to classify the language of an input word, including MLP, CNN, logistic regression, and random forest. 
Currently, the classifiers distinguish between English and Spanish.

Each character in a word is converted into a one-hot character vector of length 32. 
All special characters (the five accented vowels and Ã±) are placed at the end of the character. 
The input data is the concatenation of all these character vectors, and if the word is shorter than `max_word_length`, the data is padded with zeros. 

There are a number of pre-trained models included in the `models/` directory, although many of them use a different network structure. 
The exact structure of each of model is provided below.

`models/model_full*.ckpt`: ReLU or sigmoid(gamma * x) activations
* Convolution layer with 32 3x3 filters
* Maxpool
* Convolution layer with 32 3x3 filters
* Fully connected layer with 256 nodes
* Fully connected layer with 128 nodes
* Output layer with 2 nodes
